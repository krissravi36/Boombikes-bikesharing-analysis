## General Information
### Background:
- The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module. 
### Business Problem:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes a Mobility Services firm has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
### Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations
### Dataset
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

## Conclusions
- The company should focus on increasing the number of bikes when the temperature is high as the demand is high when the temperature is high.
- The company should focus on increasing the number of bikes when the weather condition is clear as the demand is high when the weather condition is clear.
- The company should focus on increasing the number of bikes when the windspeed is low as the demand is high when the windspeed is low.
- The company should focus on increasing the number of bikes on sundays as the demand is high on sundays.
